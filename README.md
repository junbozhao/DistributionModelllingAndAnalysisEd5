# DistributionModelllingAndAnalysisEd5
This repository contains the files for the 5th Edition of Distribution System Modeling and Analysis by Bill Kersting and Bob Kerestes.

Each chapter folder contains the textbook examples. In addition, each chapter folder contains functions to run the examples. It should be noted that the functions are needed and must be in the same path as the respective example or else they will not run. 

There is a folder with lectures from ECE 1710 - Power Distribution Engineering and Smart Grids at the University of Pittsburgh. These lecture slides may be modified by anyone using the textbook.
